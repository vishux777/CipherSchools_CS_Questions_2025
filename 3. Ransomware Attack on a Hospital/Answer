1. What are the cybersecurity principles violated here (CIA Triad)?
    The ransomware attack violates all three pillars of the CIA Triad â€” Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability:
        (1) Availability:
            Access to patient data and operational systems has been blocked, 
            disrupting essential healthcare services such as surgeries 
            and treatments.
        (2) Confidentiality:
            Sensitive patient data, including personally identifiable
            information (PII), may have been accessed or stolen. This leads
            to privacy violations and potential misuse of medical data.
        (3) Integrity:
            There is a risk that patient records were tampered with or 
            corrupted. Altered medical information can result in wrong 
            diagnoses or unsafe treatments.

2. How could PII and CII be involved in this situation?
    (1) Personally Identifiable Information (PII):
        Patient names, contact details, medical histories, 
        insurance data, and government-issued IDs could be 
        compromised. If leaked or sold, this data could be used 
        for identity theft or financial fraud.

    (2) Critical Information Infrastructure (CII):
        Hospitals are classified as part of CII because they 
        are essential to public health and safety. Any disruption 
        can threaten lives and national stability, making their 
        protection a top priority under national cybersecurity policies.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. Propose a cybersecurity framework the hospital should adopt going forward.
    To prevent similar incidents in the future, the hospital should adopt a robust
    cybersecurity strategy. One of the most effective frameworks is the NIST 
    Cybersecurity Framework (CSF), which includes:
        (1) Identify:
            Understand critical assets, risks, and vulnerabilities.
        (2) Protect:
            Implement technical controls such as encryption, access 
            restrictions, antivirus systems, and patch management.
        (3) Detect:
            Deploy monitoring and logging tools to identify 
            suspicious activities early.
        (4) Respond:
            Develop and regularly update an incident response plan 
            to handle cyberattacks effectively.
        (5) Recover:
            Maintain secure backups and test disaster recovery procedures 
            to ensure quick restoration of services.
