1. Classify the types of data exposed (PII or not).
    The following types of data were leaked:
        (1) Passwords :- PII – While technically not identifying 
            alone, passwords when linked with usernames or emails 
            become a major privacy risk.
        (2) Private Messages :- PII – Messages often contain names, 
            contact info, addresses, and personal or sensitive conversations.
        (3) Location Histories :- PII – Precise location data can be 
            used to track a person’s movements and infer sensitive 
            lifestyle patterns.
    All of these data types are classified as PII under most global 
    privacy laws (GDPR, CCPA, etc.) due to their potential to identify 
    or profile individuals.

2. What were likely technical and human errors that caused the breach?
    (1) Technical Errors:
        (A) Weak or outdated encryption for passwords.
        (B) Lack of end-to-end encryption for private messages.
        (C) Insecure APIs exposing location data.
        (D) Improper access controls that allowed unauthorized queries to the database.
        (E) No proper anomaly detection system to identify data exfiltration patterns.

    (2) Human Errors:
        (A) Social engineering or phishing attacks targeting employees.
        (B) Misconfigured cloud storage buckets.
        (C) Failure to apply critical security patches on time.
        (D) Poor password hygiene among employees/admins.
        (E) Over-permissive roles granted to internal staff or third-party vendors.

3. How does this case reflect the broader need for cybersecurity?
    This case reflects the broader and growing need for robust cybersecurity 
    in today's ' digital landscape. As social media platforms become central to 
    communication, networking, and personal expression, they also become prime 
    targets for cyberattacks. The breach underscores how deeply personal 
    information—such as passwords, private messages, and location histories—can 
    be exploited when security is insufficient. It highlights the necessity of 
    implementing strong encryption standards, strict access controls, and 
    proactive monitoring systems. Moreover, it shows that cybersecurity is 
    not just a technical concern but a strategic and ethical responsibility. 
    Organizations must invest in secure architectures like zero-trust models, 
    train their employees to recognize social engineering tactics, and 
    regularly audit their systems for vulnerabilities. Ultimately, incidents 
    like this erode user trust, damage reputations, and emphasize that 
    cybersecurity must be foundational—not optional—in the design and operation 
    of any digital service handling personal data.
